iotp2p provides p2p communication for the Internet of Things.

This project is still in its infancy and anything in this repository provides any real functionality yet.

If you are looking for a solution to have your IoT application messaging deployed please contact the owner 
of this repository to provide help in development, if you are so inclined.

If you are looking for a ready solution to build your platform, but you cannot contribute, please look elsewhere 
as this is not likely to be functional in the very near future.
